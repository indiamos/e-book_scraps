/* WTF?
-------
This is how I handle tall images in iBooks and Adobe RMSDK, which don't always scale to fit the height of the device screen or application window.

This code was made possible by Liz Castro's post “Centering in ebooks across ereaders,” March 23, 2012 <http://www.pigsgourdsandwikis.com/2012/03/centering-in-ebooks-across-ereaders.html> */

/* CSS stub: */

.fig_50 {
  text-align: center;
	page-break-inside: avoid;
	width: 50%;
	margin-left: auto;
	margin-right: auto;
	display: inline-block;
}

/* HTML stub: */

<div class="sfigs">
    <div class="fig_50">
      <img src="images/tall-narrow-image.jpg" alt="this is a pain in the ass" />
    </div>
  </div>

/* Usage
--------
I usually end up setting a couple of scaling levels, from 40% to 90%, which I apply depending on the aspect ratio of each image. (I set up a file once to determine the best break points, but I got derailed and haven't finished that project.) If I have a lot of these to deal with, I set up a spreadsheet containing the width and height of each image, and I calculate the aspect ratio for each and sort on that. I then assign a scaling percentage to each range of ratios, and I use this data to RegEx together the HTML for each image so I can just cut and paste it in.

This method does not work in Mobi7, but images automatically scale to fit the screen, there, anyway. Sometimes you don't *want* images to scale ot fit, though--as small ones will sometimes blow up all pixelly--so having a spreadsheet of image sizes also makes it much easier to identify affected images (again, I don't know the exact break point for this, but IIRC it's in Joshua Tallent's book) and merge together the HTML with explicit dimensions, to paste in.

I do not put explicit dimensions on images *above* the necessary size for Mobi7 because in Adobe RMSDK, they'll scale unproportionally in some instances, and you get bizarre and nasty stretchy effects. */
